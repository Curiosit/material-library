## Material library
Material library is Work-in-progress nextjs app for architects and investors for searching ideal materials for their projects. User can search the library and sort materials according to various metrics: costs, density, function, carbon footprint, etc.

The app uses database from table 7 csv file generated by https://github.com/ocni-dtu/table7

- Next.js, Vercel deployment, MongoDB
- Python for data manipulation & upload to MongoDB
- D3 and ChartJS for data visualization

The app has been deployed to vercel: https://material-library.vercel.app/

## Forking and testing
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
